          <p>SURPA-YARUA PUNISHED</p>

<p>Rama heard her impious purpose and a gentle smile repressed,
To the foul and forward female thus his mocking words addressed:</p>

<p>"List, O passion-smitten maiden! Sita is my honoured wife,
With a rival loved and cherished cruel were thy wedded life!</p>

<p>But no consort follows Lakshman, peerless is his comely face,
Dauntless is his warlike valour, matchless is his courtly grace,</p>

<p>And he leads no wife or consort to this darksome woodland grove,
With no rival to thy passion seek his ample-hearted love! "</p>

<p>Surpa-nakha passion-laden then on Lakshman turned her eye,
But in merry mocking accents smiling Lakshman made reply.</p>

<p>Ruddy in thy youthful beauty like the lotus in her pride,
I am slave of royal Rama, would'st thou be a vassal's bride?</p>

<p>Rather be his younger consort, banish Sita from his arms,
Spurning Sita's faded beauty let him seek thy fresher charms,</p>

<p>Spurning Sita's faded graces let him brighter pleasures prove,
Wearied with a woman's dalliance let him court a Raksha's love!"</p>

<p>Wrath of unrequited passion raged like madness in her breast,
Torn by anger strong as tempest thus her answer she addrest:</p>

<p>Are these mocking accents uttered, Rama, to insult my flame,
Feasting on her faded beauty dost thou still revere thy dame?</p>

<p>But beware a Raksha's fury and an injured female's wrath,
Surpa-nakha slays thy consort, bears no rival in her path!"</p>

<p>Fawn-eyed Sita fell in terror as the Raksha rose to slay,
So beneath the flaming meteor sinks Rohini's softer ray,</p>

<p>And like Demon of Destruction furious Surpa -nakha came,
Rama rose to stop the slaughter and protect his helpless dame.</p>

<p>"Brother, we have acted wrongly, for with those of savage breed,
Word in jest is courting danger,--this the penance of our deed,</p>

<p>Death perchance or death-like stupor hovers o'er my lov√©d dame,
Let me wake to life my Sita, chase this female void of shame!"</p>

<p>Lakshman's anger leaped like lightning as the female hovered near.
With his sword the wrathful warrior cleft her nose and either ear,</p>

<p>Surpa-nakha in her anguish raised her accents shrill and high,
And the rocks and wooded valleys answered back the dismal cry,</p>

<p>Khara and the doughty Dushan heard the far-resounding wail,
Saw her red disfigured visage, heard her sad and woeful tale!</p>
