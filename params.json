Sita is my honoured wife,\r\nWith a rival loved and cherished cruel were thy wedded life!\r\n\r\nBut no consort follows Lakshman, peerless is his comely face,\r\nDauntless is his warlike valour, matchless is his courtly grace,\r\n\r\nAnd he leads no wife or consort to this darksome woodland grove,\r\nWith no rival to thy passion seek his ample-hearted love! \"\r\n\r\nSurpa-nakha passion-laden then on Lakshman turned her eye,\r\nBut in merry mocking accents smiling Lakshman made reply.\r\n\r\nRuddy in thy youthful beauty like the lotus in her pride,\r\nI am slave of royal Rama, would'st thou be a vassal's bride?\r\n\r\nRather be his younger consort, banish Sita from his arms,\r\nSpurning Sita's faded beauty let him seek thy fresher charms,\r\n\r\nSpurning Sita's faded graces let him brighter pleasures prove,\r\nWearied with a woman's dalliance let him court a Raksha's love!\"\r\n\r\nWrath of unrequited passion raged like madness in her breast,\r\nTorn by anger strong as tempest thus her answer she addrest:\r\n\r\nAre these mocking accents uttered, Rama, to insult my flame,\r\nFeasting on her faded beauty dost thou still revere thy dame?\r\n\r\nBut beware a Raksha's fury and an injured female's wrath,\r\nSurpa-nakha slays thy consort, bears no rival in her path!\"\r\n\r\nFawn-eyed Sita fell in terror as the Raksha rose to slay,\r\nSo beneath the flaming meteor sinks Rohini's softer ray,\r\n\r\nAnd like Demon of Destruction furious Surpa -nakha came,\r\nRama rose to stop the slaughter and protect his helpless dame.\r\n\r\n\"Brother, we have acted wrongly, for with those of savage breed,\r\nWord in jest is courting danger,--this the penance of our deed,\r\n\r\nDeath perchance or death-like stupor hovers o'er my lov√©d dame,\r\nLet me wake to life my Sita, chase this female void of shame!\"\r\n\r\nLakshman's anger leaped like lightning as the female hovered near.\r\nWith his sword the wrathful warrior cleft her nose and either ear,\r\n\r\nSurpa-nakha in her anguish raised her accents shrill and high,\r\nAnd the rocks and wooded valleys answered back the dismal cry,\r\n\r\nKhara and the doughty Dushan heard the far-resounding wail,\r\nSaw her red disfigured visage, heard her sad and woeful tale!","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
